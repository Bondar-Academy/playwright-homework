# Playwright Homework
A framework template to perform homework for the class "SDET with Playwright"

## Configuration
1. Rename ```.env-SAMPLE``` file to ```.env```
2. Update ```.env``` file with a valid Bondar Academy credentials
    Example:
    ```
    EMAIL='test@test.com'
    PASSWORD='Welcome1'
    ```

P.S. ```.env```file is added to ```.gitignore``` so it will not be version controlled. 
Once you rename the file to ```.env``` the sample file will be added to deletion on the next commit,
so it will be deleted from the GitHub and only ```.env``` file will be stored locally.
